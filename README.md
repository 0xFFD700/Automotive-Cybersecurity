<h1> Ethics </h1>
This research uses data derived from surveys with humans in the automotive industry. 
Therefore, ethical considerations were incorporated into the survey's design decisions. 
All participants did so voluntarily; no monetary or other incentives were provided. 
The first page and the call for the survey described the purpose for which the collected data will be used and who processes it. 
All data was collected anonymously via the GDPR-compliant <a href="https://www.soscisurvey.de/en/index">SoSci platform</a>, and the authors had no access to personal information. 
Since the data cannot be used to draw conclusions about the participant, there is no potential for harm from employees not representing the employer's opinion. 
This study reveals gaps in automotive IT security regulations, emphasising the importance of the surveyed jobs. 
The original survey data will be published with this research to ensure the results are communicated accurately. 
Since no basic ethical principles were violated and the participants were not harmed, approval from the Institutional Review Board is not necessary.
